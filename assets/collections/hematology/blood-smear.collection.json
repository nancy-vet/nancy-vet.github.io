In many species, once the cell reaches the reticulocyte stage, it remains in the bone marrow for about 2 days, then is released to complete its maturation by losing its RNA and some of its surface membrane while it circulates. This is usually accomplished in the spleen. Consequently, low numbers of polychromatophils are seen in healthy dogs (< 1.5% reticulocytes)."
