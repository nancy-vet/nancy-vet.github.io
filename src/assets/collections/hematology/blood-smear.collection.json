It is due to the presence of polyribosomes and rough endoplasmic reticulum.", "► Döhle bodies: These are pale round to linear blue aggregates in the cytoplasm, caused by whorls of rough endoplasmic reticulum. Healthy cats can have low numbers of small Döhle bodies", "► Cytoplasmic vacuolation: These are indistinct vacuoles in the cytoplasm, giving it a frothy appearance and is due to degranulation of lysosomes. Note that clear punctate vacuoles are usually not attributed to toxic change, but are frequently another storage-related artifact (these vacuoles can occur within 4 hours of blood collection).", "► Nuclear immaturity: The nuclear chromatin is lighter (finer) and less coarsely clumped than normal.", "► Toxic granulation: These are distinct red granules in the cytoplasm due to the primary granules taking up stain."
