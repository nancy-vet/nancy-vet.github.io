          "Dogs can be infected with various Babesia organisms. Most of the parasites belong to Babesia sensu stricto genus, which includes large organisms, such as B. canis, B. rossi and B. vogeli and the smaller organisms, B. gibsoni.", "Mild disease is mainly an extravascular hemolytic anemia but severely affected dogs have signs of intravascular hemolysis (as the parasite lyses the red blood cell to complete its lifecycle) and may develop disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).", "B. canis appear usually as single or multiple (pairs or tetrads, in so-called Maltese cross formations) large organisms in the red blood cells in smears.", "Low-grade parasitemia is more easily detected by examination of a buffy coat smear prepared from blood collected from small peripheral vessels, such as in the ear, than a blood smear made from a central vein (e.g. jugular vein). Babesia organisms are removed from peripheral red blood cells in the spleen, resulting in asymptomatic carriers.", "In comparison to Babesia canis, Babesia gibsoni is much smaller and forms rings with a dark nucleus on one side in the red blood cell. They can be readily missed on cursory blood smear examination.", "Babesia felis is a rare parasite that can produce a regenerative anemia, lethargy and anorexia in cats. The parasite is very small and quite difficult to visualize. Affected cats can be icteric and hyperglobulinemic."
